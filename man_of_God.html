        <h2>What does it mean to be a man of God</h2>
        <h3>Instructions to be a man of God</h3>
        <p>1 Corinthians 16:13</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Be on Guard. Stand firm in the faith. Be courageous. Be strong.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>1 Timothy 6:11</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>“But you, are a man of God; so run from all these evil things. Pursue righteousness and a Godly life, along with faith, love, perserverance and gentlesness”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Proverbs 1:7</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>“Fear of the Lord is the foundation of true knowledge but a fool despises wisdom and discipline”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>How to grow into more of a Man of God?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Praying</li>
          <p>  By communicating with God you open a door for conversation in which you can express yourself and your upmost desires and requests. God knows everything however by praying to God you can become closer to God.

           God is an immanent God when you come close to him, he will come close to you.
  <blockquote> “Come close to God and God will come close to you. Wash your hands, you sinners;purify your hearts, for your loyalty is divided between God and the world”.</blockquote>
</p>  
         <li>Study the Gospels and study Christ’s Character</li>
         <p>
            The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John all account of Jesus’ time on earth and how Jesus interacted with humanity.

            By focusing on Christ’s character you can replicate this in your own life and live a christ like life on how you interact with people. A common theme is that you can describe Christ in so many different ways, however one chracteristic that I would like to build is to “have a passion for God’s house”.

         </p>


            <li>Learn from men of God in the bible regarding successes and failures. Trials and Tribulations</li>

            <p>
                If we look at a man of God like Joseph, he went through hard times but by being persistant and strong with God and in faith he came out of the difficult times and rose againts everyone who tryed to put him down and “Potiphar could see the blessing upon Joseph, giving him success in everything he did.” By allowing yourself to go through the tribulation and the trials you need to trust in God. God’s plans are perfect and you need to adhere to his commands. God can send you somewhere that you dont want to go to and he will put you through the tribulation in which this can make you turn back and obey him (Jonah)             
            </p>
            <li>Be disciplined</li>
            <p>
                One of the hardest parts of being a human in general is to stay disciplined and committed to something. Discipline requires God’s strength at times. Allow yourself to do what you dont want to do. For example if you are too lazy or too tired to read the bibe or pray GO AND DO IT. After you do so you will feel better about yourself and feel like you can do the next action and develop yourself better.
            </p>

            <li>Grow the fruits of the spirit</li>
            <p>Love, Joy, Peace, forbearance, kindness, Goodness, faithfulness, gentlesness and self-control.</p>

            <li>Requires a daily walk witht the Lord and find him in a personal level.</li>
            <p>This can be one of the most difficult steps yet however it is vital that we try to do so at all times. Don’t make it a singular motion experience or a sudden sense of motivation to walk with God but it should be a lifestyle.</p>
        </ul>
