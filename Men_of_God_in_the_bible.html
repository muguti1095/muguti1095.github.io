        <h2>Genesis 37-50</h2>
        <p>Joseph was his father’s (Jacob) favourite son</p>
        <p>This lead to his brothers hating him</p>
        <p>Joseph’s brothers didnt like him more because of his dreams which were interpreted that his brothers would bow down to Joseph.</p>
        <blockquote>This teaches that it doesnt matter who hates you but you will always come out victorious and if its God’s will then it will happen (Genesis 37:8)</blockquote>
        <p>Josephs Brother’s planned to kill him but Reuben went against it to save Joseph</p>
        <blockquote>This teaches that you will always have atleast one person you can go to</blockquote>
        <p>TimeLine so far:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Joseph is Jacobs favourite</li>
            <li>Jacob sends Joseph to check on his brothers who were pasturing the sheep</li>
            <li>His brothers were at Dothan.</li>
            <li>His brothers plotted to kill him</li>
            <li>Reuben reevaluated this and saved him and placed him in a ditch</li>
            <li>His brothers sold him to an Ishmaelite</li>
            <li>The Ishmaelite sold him to Potiphar in Egypt</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Chapter 39</h2>
        <p>Verse 2</p>
