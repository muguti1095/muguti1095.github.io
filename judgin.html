        <h3>James 4:11-12</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>James says not to judge others</li>
            <li>Judging others has nothing to do with others, instead has everything to do with you (ref Matthew 7:1-5)</li>
            <li>Jesus says do not judge others or you will be judged</li>
            <li><blockquote>(1 Corinthians 5:3-5) </blockquote>Paul encounters a problem in the Church in Corinth with a man who is committing an act of perversion with his stepmother</li>
            <li>Paul says to throw him out because he has already judged him</li>
            <li>In Paul’s situation, he must step in as the issue lies within Church discipline and sin not being dealt with, he is acting on his apostolic authority to judge this sin</li>
            <li>We can’t pass a final verdict on someone; in doing this, we are putting ourselves in a superior position, acting as the ultimate judge, however, this is God's position, we don’t have the authority to do this as we are not sinless</li>
            <li>We can’t expect perfection from others when we know we ourselves aren’t at a place of perfection yet</li>
            <li>If we notice a mistake someone has made, we can point it out, as this can not only help our one-on-one fellowship but also can help strengthen the other person's relationship with God, however, we mustn’t make a final verdict as this is God's job</li>
            <li>When we make a final verdict, we indirectly say that even God can’t change it</li>
            <li>If we conclude that an issue can’t be fixed, what we say is that Jesus can’t fix it, then the issue doesn’t come down to the relationship of us together as people, but it comes down to our relationship with God</li>
        </ul>
